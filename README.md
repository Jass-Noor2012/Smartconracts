## 🎉 Welcome to My Solidity Smart Contract Project! 🎉

Hello there, welcome to my project! For this project, I have written a smart contract that implements the Create Post(), Like post() and follow() functions within a social site in a game and use html and JavaScript for interaction with frontend.

### Description
Here I have created a scenario in a game for social interaction for users. This project is all about creating and liking posts, and follow user in the game. Here's a quick rundown:

#### Creating post
Users can create their own  post.It takes some basic amount of ETH to create a post.

#### Like post
This LikePost() function like the post of given ID with a given amount of ETH.

#### Follow User
Want to share the Follow someone in game? 😼😼 You can follow then just by providing their address with followUser function.

easy-to-use HTML interface... 👍👍
